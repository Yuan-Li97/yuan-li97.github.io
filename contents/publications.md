    Sophisticated present-biased entrepreneurs adopt a zero-leverage policy to commit against future over-borrowing, whereas naive entrepreneurs underestimate their future refinancing incentives, leading to unstable capital structures and exploitation by lenders.

    Present bias plays a dual role in sovereign debt dynamics: it drives aggressive borrowing at moderate debt levels for immediate gratification but incentivizes debt repurchases at high debt levels to delay costly default.

    Incorporating heterogeneous present bias into a heterogeneous-agent model enables it to jointly match US wealth distribution and average marginal propensity to consume, resolving a common tension in standard models.

"[Commitment, Agency Costs and Dynamic Capital Structure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1351847X.2021.2010782)," **Yuan Li**, [Jinqiang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=LT4oF5cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Siqi Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/siqi-zhao0411), **The European Journal of Finance**, 2022, 28, 1708-1727.

    Committing to a firm-optimal debt policy eliminates the leverage ratchet effect by forcing debt repurchases in high-leverage states, but this commitment can reduce enterprise value when debt adjustment costs are high or debt maturity is short.

    通过构建理论模型论证了在风险对冲工具不足的“非完备市场”下，交易平台实施逆周期的碳配额管理机制能在政府与企业间合理分担碳价风险，从而降低企业低碳转型成本、改善碳价发现功能并助力实现“双碳”目标。
